# Life-Expectancy-Analysis-Based-on-Sustainable-Development-Indicators
18 Different SDGs were analysed in an attempt to use them to predict life expectancy in 
low, low-middle, and upper-middle-income countries. Of the 18 SDGs, only ten were used 
to train the models due to a large amount of missing data or features providing little 
meaningful information concerning life expectancy. The performance of a linear 
regression model was compared to that of a Random Forest Classifier, with the Random 
Forest model achieving the highest accuracy while being more susceptible to overfitting.
